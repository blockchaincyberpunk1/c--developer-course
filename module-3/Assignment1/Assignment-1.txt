Understanding C++ Application Structure

Objective: Explore the structure of a well-organized C++ application.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will gain a deeper understanding of the structure of a well-organized C++ application. You will learn about the importance of organizing code into header (.h) and source (.cpp) files and using namespaces for code organization. Below are the details of the assignment:

Part 1: Understanding Code Organization (10 points)

Write a brief explanation (150-200 words) of why it is essential to organize C++ code into separate header (.h) and source (.cpp) files in an application. Discuss the advantages of this approach and how it contributes to code modularity and maintainability.
Part 2: Creating a Structured C++ Program (20 points)

Develop a simple C++ program that follows a structured approach with separate header and source files. Your program should perform a straightforward task, such as calculating the factorial of a number or finding the sum of elements in an array.

Your program should include the following elements:

A header file (.h) that contains the function prototypes and any necessary class declarations.
A source file (.cpp) that implements the functions defined in the header file.
Proper use of namespaces to encapsulate your code. Create a custom namespace to enclose your functions and variables.
A main function that calls the functions defined in the source file.
Part 3: Documentation (10 points)

Provide comments within your code to explain the purpose of each function and any critical code segments. Ensure that your code is well-documented for clarity.
Submission:

Submit your C++ program, including both the header (.h) and source (.cpp) files, along with your written explanation of the importance of code organization. Ensure that your code is well-structured and organized.

Grading Criteria:

Clear and concise explanation of the importance of organizing C++ code.
A well-structured C++ program with separate header and source files.
Proper use of namespaces to encapsulate code.
Effective comments and documentation within the code.
Correctness and functionality of the C++ program.
Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

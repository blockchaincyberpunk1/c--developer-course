Memory Management Best Practices in C++

Objective: Explore best practices for memory management in C++.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will delve into best practices for memory management in C++. You will research and compile a list of these best practices and then apply them in a C++ program. The goal is to create a program that exemplifies these practices while focusing on efficient memory usage and avoiding common memory-related issues. Here are the details of the assignment:

Part 1: Research on Memory Management Best Practices (15 points)

Conduct research to identify and compile a list of best practices for memory management in C++. These best practices should cover topics such as memory allocation, deallocation, avoiding memory leaks, and improving code efficiency. Write a document (200-250 words) summarizing these best practices.
Part 2: C++ Program Demonstrating Best Practices (35 points)

Develop a C++ program that exemplifies the memory management best practices you researched in Part 1. Your program should perform the following tasks:
Dynamically allocate memory for data structures or objects.
Properly release memory when it is no longer needed, ensuring there are no memory leaks.
Use appropriate data types and sizes to minimize memory consumption.
Avoid common memory-related issues, such as accessing deallocated memory or using uninitialized pointers.
Implement efficient memory management strategies, such as reuse of memory blocks or smart pointers.
Part 3: Documentation (10 points)

Provide comments and documentation within your C++ program to explain how you have implemented each of the memory management best practices. Make sure your code is well-documented for clarity.
Part 4: Reflection (10 points)

Write a brief reflection (150-200 words) on your experience implementing memory management best practices in your C++ program. Discuss any challenges you encountered, the benefits of following these practices, and how they contribute to writing robust and efficient C++ code.
Submission:

Submit your C++ program, the document summarizing memory management best practices, and your reflection. Ensure that your code effectively demonstrates the best practices and adheres to good coding standards.

Grading Criteria:

Comprehensive and well-structured list of memory management best practices.
A well-documented C++ program that effectively implements these best practices.
Proper comments and documentation within the code.
Correctness and functionality of the C++ program.
Clear and insightful reflection on the experience of implementing best practices.
Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

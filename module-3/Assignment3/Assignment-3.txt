Smart Pointers in C++

Objective: Study smart pointers as a safer alternative for memory management.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will explore the concept of smart pointers in C++ and understand their role in memory management. You will also gain practical experience by developing a C++ program that utilizes smart pointers for memory management. Here are the details of the assignment:

Part 1: Understanding Smart Pointers (15 points)

Write an explanation (150-200 words) of what smart pointers are in C++. Describe the different types of smart pointers, including std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr. Explain how each type works and their advantages in memory management compared to raw pointers.
Part 2: C++ Program with Smart Pointers (25 points)

Develop a C++ program that demonstrates the use of smart pointers to manage memory. Your program should accomplish the following tasks:
Create a class representing a simple data structure (e.g., a linked list or a binary tree).
Use smart pointers to dynamically allocate memory for instances of this class.
Implement operations on your data structure (e.g., insert, delete, traverse) using smart pointers.
Ensure that your program correctly releases memory when objects are no longer needed.
Part 3: Advantages of Smart Pointers (10 points)

In your C++ program, include comments to explain how smart pointers are used and the advantages they offer over manual memory allocation and deallocation using raw pointers.
Part 4: Documentation (10 points)

Provide comments within your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section, especially the parts that involve smart pointers. Ensure that your code is well-documented for clarity.
Submission:

Submit your C++ program, including comments, and your written explanation of smart pointers. Make sure that your code effectively demonstrates the advantages of smart pointers over manual memory allocation.

Grading Criteria:

Clear and concise explanation of smart pointers in C++.
A well-structured C++ program that effectively uses smart pointers for memory management.
Proper comments and documentation within the code.
Correctness and functionality of the C++ program.
Demonstrated advantages of smart pointers in memory management.
Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

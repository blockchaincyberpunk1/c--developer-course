Inheritance and Polymorphism in C++

Objective: Understand inheritance and polymorphism in C++.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will explore the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in C++. You will create a base class and derived classes to demonstrate inheritance and implement polymorphism using virtual functions. Below are the tasks for this assignment:

Introduction to Inheritance (15 points):

Begin by explaining the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP).
Discuss the significance of inheritance in code reusability and the organization of related classes.
Describe types of inheritance in C++, such as single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.
Define a Base Class (20 points):

Define a C++ base class representing a generic entity (e.g., an animal, a shape).
Include data members and member functions in the base class that are relevant to the entity.
Implement at least one virtual function in the base class to enable polymorphism.
Create Derived Classes (20 points):

Create two or more derived classes that inherit from the base class.
Each derived class should represent a specific type of the entity (e.g., a dog and a cat if the base class is "animal").
Add unique data members and member functions to each derived class to represent their distinct characteristics.
Polymorphism Using Virtual Functions (20 points):

Implement polymorphism by using virtual functions in the base class.
Override the virtual function in each derived class with specific implementations.
Write a C++ program that demonstrates how polymorphism works when objects of derived classes are treated as objects of the base class.
Documentation and Comments (15 points):

Create a well-structured document that presents your base class, derived classes, and program.
Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of the classes, functions, and key code segments.
Use appropriate headings and formatting for clarity.
Testing and Output (10 points):

Ensure that your program runs without errors.
Include sample output in your document that illustrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism.
Test different scenarios to showcase the behavior of base and derived classes.
Submission:

Submit your assignment document that includes the class definitions, C++ program, comments, and sample output. Make sure your document is organized and easy to follow.

Grading Criteria:

Clear explanations of inheritance and its significance in OOP.
Well-defined base class structure with relevant data members and virtual functions.
Creation of meaningful derived classes with unique characteristics.
Effective demonstration of polymorphism through virtual functions.
Documentation that is well-organized and includes helpful comments.
Correct and meaningful sample output that showcases inheritance and polymorphism.

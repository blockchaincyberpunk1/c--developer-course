Advanced C++ Features

Objective: Study advanced C++ language features.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will dive into advanced C++ features to expand your programming skills. You will explore topics like operator overloading, templates, exception handling, and dynamic memory allocation. Your task is to write C++ code that showcases the use of at least one advanced feature. Below are the details of the assignment:

Introduction (10 points):

Start with a brief introduction to the purpose of this assignment.
Mention the advanced C++ features you will explore (e.g., operator overloading, templates, exception handling, dynamic memory allocation).
Choose a Feature (10 points):

Select one of the advanced features (e.g., operator overloading, templates, exception handling, dynamic memory allocation) that you want to focus on for this assignment.
Provide a rationale for your choice and explain why it interests you.
Code Implementation (40 points):

Write C++ code that effectively demonstrates the chosen advanced feature.
If you choose operator overloading, create a class and overload an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /) to perform custom operations.
If you choose templates, design a template class or function that works with multiple data types.
If you choose exception handling, create a program that handles exceptions gracefully and provides informative error messages.
If you choose dynamic memory allocation, use the new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate memory.
Documentation and Comments (20 points):

Create a well-structured document that includes your C++ code.
Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of classes, functions, and key code segments.
Provide explanations of how your code showcases the chosen advanced feature.
Testing and Output (10 points):

Ensure that your program runs without errors.
Include sample output or test cases that demonstrate the functionality of your code.
If applicable, test your code with different inputs or scenarios to highlight its flexibility.
Submission:

Submit your assignment document that includes the C++ code, comments, explanations, and sample output. Make sure your document is organized and easy to follow.

Grading Criteria:

Clear explanation of the chosen advanced feature and rationale for selection.
Effective implementation of the chosen feature in C++ code.
Well-structured code with meaningful comments.
Correct and meaningful sample output or test cases.
Demonstrated understanding of the advanced feature and its application.

Mastering Inheritance and Polymorphism in C++
Welcome to the realm of advanced C++ programming concepts â€“ inheritance and polymorphism. As a beginner C++ developer, you're about to delve into the depths of these powerful mechanisms that enable you to design more flexible, organized, and extensible code. In this comprehensive guide, we'll unlock the secrets of inheritance, exploring the concepts of base classes, derived classes, and access control. Additionally, we'll demystify the magic of polymorphism, showing you how to implement it using virtual functions and function overriding. By the end of this journey, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create sophisticated and adaptable software solutions.

Building on the Past: Understanding Inheritance
Introduction to Inheritance
Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes from existing ones. Inheritance models an is-a relationship, where a derived class inherits properties and behaviors from a base class.

By using inheritance, you can:

Reuse code from existing classes, reducing redundancy.
Extend the functionality of a class by adding new attributes and methods.
Override methods to provide specialized behavior.
Base and Derived Classes
In inheritance, a base class (also called a parent class) serves as the foundation for creating new classes. A derived class (also called a child class) inherits attributes and methods from the base class while having the ability to add new ones.

Here's a simple example:

cpp
Copy code
class Shape {
public:
    void display() {
        std::cout << "This is a shape." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void displayCircle() {
        std::cout << "This is a circle." << std::endl;
    }
};
In this example, Shape is the base class, and Circle is the derived class. The Circle class inherits the display() method from the Shape class.

Access Control and Inheritance
In C++, access control determines how the members of a base class are inherited by a derived class. There are three access control levels:

public: Public members of the base class are inherited as public members in the derived class.
protected: Public and protected members of the base class are inherited as protected members in the derived class.
private: All members of the base class are inherited as private members in the derived class.
cpp
Copy code
class Base {
public:
    int pubVar;
protected:
    int protVar;
private:
    int privVar;
};

class Derived : public Base {
    // pubVar inherited as public
    // protVar inherited as protected
    // privVar not accessible in Derived
};
Embracing Diversity: Polymorphism in Action
Understanding Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types without needing to know their specific implementations.

Polymorphism enables:

Writing more flexible and generic code.
Creating code that can work with future classes without modification.
Implementing different behaviors for different derived classes.
Virtual Functions: The Heart of Polymorphism
The foundation of polymorphism lies in virtual functions, which are functions declared in the base class and overridden in derived classes. Virtual functions ensure that the appropriate function is called based on the type of the object being used.

cpp
Copy code
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void display() {
        std::cout << "This is a shape." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void display() override {
        std::cout << "This is a circle." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Triangle : public Shape {
public:
    void display() override {
        std::cout << "This is a triangle." << std::endl;
    }
};
In this example, the display() function is declared as virtual in the Shape class. Both the Circle and Triangle classes override this function to provide their specific implementations.

Function Overriding: Implementing Polymorphism
To achieve polymorphism, you need to override virtual functions in the derived classes. Overriding ensures that the appropriate function is called based on the runtime type of the object.

cpp
Copy code
void displayShapeInfo(Shape* shape) {
    shape->display(); // Calls the appropriate display() based on object's type
}

int main() {
    Circle circle;
    Triangle triangle;

    displayShapeInfo(&circle); // Calls display() from Circle class
    displayShapeInfo(&triangle); // Calls display() from Triangle class

    return 0;
}
In this example, the displayShapeInfo() function takes a pointer to a Shape object. When this function is called with instances of Circle and Triangle, the appropriate display() function is called based on the actual type of the object.

Putting Theory into Practice: Code Examples
Example 1: Vehicle Hierarchy
Let's create a hierarchy of vehicles using inheritance and implement polymorphism:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void displayType() {
        std::cout << "This is a vehicle." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void displayType() override {
        std::cout << "This is a car." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Bicycle : public Vehicle {
public:
    void displayType() override {
        std::cout << "This is a bicycle." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Vehicle vehicle;
    Car car;
    Bicycle bicycle;

    vehicle.displayType(); // Output: This is a vehicle.
    car.displayType(); // Output: This is a car.
    bicycle.displayType(); // Output: This is a bicycle.

    return 0;
}
In this example, we define a Vehicle base class and derived classes Car and Bicycle. We use polymorphism to display the type of each vehicle, irrespective of its actual class.

Example 2: Banking System
Let's implement a banking system using inheritance and polymorphism:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

class Account {
protected:
    double balance;

public:
    Account(double bal) : balance(bal) {}

    virtual void displayBalance() {
        std::cout << "Balance: $" << balance << std::endl;
    }

    virtual void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            std::cout << "Withdrawal successful." << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Insufficient balance." << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

class SavingsAccount : public Account {
public:
    SavingsAccount(double bal) : Account(bal) {}

    void displayBalance() override {
        std::cout << "Savings ";
        Account::displayBalance();
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) override {
        if (balance - amount >= 100) {
            Account::withdraw(amount);
        } else {
            std::cout << "Minimum balance of $100 required." << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    SavingsAccount savings(1000.0);
    Account* accPtr = &savings;

    accPtr->displayBalance(); // Output: Savings Balance: $1000
    accPtr->withdraw(200.0); // Output: Withdrawal successful.

    return 0;
}
In this example, we define an Account base class and a SavingsAccount derived class. We demonstrate polymorphism by using a base class pointer to call the derived class's methods.

C++ Classes and Objects

Objective: Learn how to define and use classes and objects in C++.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will dive deeper into C++ classes and objects. You'll define a class representing a real-world entity and create objects of that class to demonstrate their usage. Below are the tasks for this assignment:

Introduction to Classes and Objects (15 points):

Begin by explaining what classes and objects are in the context of C++.
Describe the structure of a C++ class, including:
Data members (attributes): Explain what data members are and how they are used to store information about objects.
Member functions (methods): Describe member functions and their role in performing actions related to the class.
Define a C++ Class (20 points):

Choose a real-world entity that you want to model using a C++ class (e.g., a car, a bank account, a student).
Define a class for this entity with appropriate data members and member functions.
Include at least two data members (attributes) and two member functions (methods) in your class.
Ensure that the class provides meaningful functionality related to the chosen entity.
Instantiate Objects (20 points):

Write a C++ program that includes the definition of the class you created.
Instantiate multiple objects of your class within the program.
Demonstrate how to set values for the data members of each object and invoke the member functions.
Provide output that showcases the interactions with the objects.
Documentation and Comments (15 points):

Create a well-structured document that presents your class definition and program.
Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of data members, member functions, and key code segments.
Use appropriate headings and formatting for clarity.
Testing and Output (15 points):

Ensure that your program runs without errors.
Include sample output in your document that illustrates the behavior of the class and objects.
Test different scenarios to showcase the flexibility and functionality of your class.
Submission:

Submit your assignment document that includes the class definition, C++ program, comments, and sample output. Make sure your document is organized and easy to follow.

Grading Criteria:

Accurate and clear explanations of classes and objects in C++.
Well-defined class structure with appropriate data members and member functions.
Successful instantiation of objects and effective demonstration of their usage.
Documentation that is well-organized and includes helpful comments.
Correct and meaningful sample output that showcases the class and object interactions.

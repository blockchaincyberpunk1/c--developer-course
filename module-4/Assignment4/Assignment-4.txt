Combining Containers and Algorithms in C++

Objective: Learn how to combine STL containers and algorithms effectively.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will explore the powerful combination of STL containers and algorithms in C++. Combining these two elements can lead to more efficient, concise, and expressive code. The objective is to understand how to use STL containers and algorithms together and apply them to solve specific programming problems.

Part 1: Understanding the Synergy (15 points)

Begin by explaining the synergy between STL containers and algorithms. Discuss how using containers to store data and algorithms to operate on that data simplifies code and leads to more maintainable and efficient solutions.

Describe the advantages of this combination, including code reusability, readability, and the ability to solve complex problems with minimal effort.

Part 2: Demonstrating STL Containers and Algorithms Combination (65 points)

Develop at least two C++ programs that showcase the use of STL containers and algorithms together. Each program should:

Create an STL container (e.g., vector, map) and populate it with sample data.
Apply one or more STL algorithms to perform specific operations on the container's data.
Clearly demonstrate how the combination of containers and algorithms simplifies the code and solves the programming problem efficiently.
You can choose from a variety of problems to solve, such as counting elements, finding duplicates, or performing data transformations.

Part 3: Reflection and Conclusion (20 points)

Reflect on your experience working with the combination of STL containers and algorithms. Discuss how this approach enhances code quality and makes complex tasks more manageable.
Submission:

Submit your C++ programs along with a well-structured document that includes explanations, code snippets, and your reflections on the benefits of combining STL containers and algorithms.

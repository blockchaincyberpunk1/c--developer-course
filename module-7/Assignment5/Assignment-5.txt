Game Development Frameworks Research

Objective: Conduct research on game development frameworks that utilize C++.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will explore a specific game development framework or engine that primarily utilizes C++ for game development. Your task is to create a detailed report or presentation on the chosen framework. This report should cover its architecture, development environment, key features, and notable games developed with it.

Part 1: Choose a Game Development Framework

Selection: Choose one game development framework or engine that predominantly relies on C++. You can select from well-known options such as Unreal Engine, CryEngine, Godot (using C++), or any other suitable framework.
Part 2: Research and Report

Framework Overview:

Name and History: Provide the name of the chosen framework and a brief history of its development.
Target Platforms: Specify the platforms (e.g., PC, consoles, mobile) for which the framework is suitable.
Architecture:

High-Level Architecture: Describe the high-level architecture of the framework, including its core components and subsystems.
Graphics Rendering: Explain how the framework handles graphics rendering and what rendering APIs it supports.
Physics Simulation: Discuss the framework's capabilities for physics simulation and interactions.
Audio Support: Mention how the framework handles audio and sound effects.
Development Environment:

IDE and Tools: Identify the integrated development environment (IDE) commonly used with the framework and any specialized tools.
Scripting Languages: If applicable, mention scripting languages (besides C++) supported by the framework.
Asset Pipeline: Explain how assets like models, textures, and audio files are imported and managed.
Key Features:

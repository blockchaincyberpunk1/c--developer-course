Data Types and Variables in C++

Objective: Explore C++ data types and variables.

Instructions:

Part 1: Understanding Data Types (40 points)

Introduction to Data Types (10 points): Describe the concept of data types in C++. Explain why data types are essential in programming and how they determine the type of data a variable can store.

Common Data Types (15 points): Discuss common built-in data types in C++, including but not limited to int, double, char, bool, and string. Explain the appropriate use cases for each data type and the range of values they can store.

Type Casting (15 points): Explain what type casting is and why it's used in C++. Provide examples of explicit and implicit type casting and discuss the potential risks associated with type casting.

Part 2: C++ Program with Data Types (60 points)

Write a C++ program that uses different data types to store and manipulate data. Follow these guidelines:

Problem Description (10 points): Choose a problem or task that involves working with various data types. Describe the problem in a comment block at the beginning of your code.

Variable Declarations (20 points): Declare and initialize variables of different data types that are relevant to your chosen problem. Use meaningful variable names.

Data Manipulation (20 points): Perform operations and manipulations on the variables to achieve the desired outcome. This may include mathematical calculations, string manipulations, or logical operations.

Type Casting (10 points, if applicable): If your problem requires type casting, demonstrate the use of type casting to convert data from one type to another safely.

Part 3: Testing and Output (20 points)

Include appropriate input prompts and demonstrate the results of your program's execution. Ensure that the output is clear and meaningful.
Submission:

Submit your C++ program code along with explanations and comments that describe the data types used, their role in solving the problem, and any type casting performed. Ensure your code is well-structured and follows best practices for readability.

Grading Criteria:

Clear and accurate explanations of data types and their importance.
Proper declaration and initialization of variables with appropriate data types.
Correct data manipulation and operations to solve the chosen problem.
Successful execution of the program with meaningful output.
Adequate documentation and comments within the code.
Proper use of type casting, if applicable.
Overall presentation and organization of the submission.

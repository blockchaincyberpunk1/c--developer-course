Programming Concepts in C++

Objective: Learn and apply fundamental programming concepts in C++.

Instructions:

Part 1: Understanding Programming Concepts (40 points)

Variables and Data Types (15 points): Explain the concepts of variables and data types in C++. Describe different data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. Discuss how variables are declared, initialized, and assigned values in C++.

Constants (10 points): Define constants in C++. Explain the difference between constant and variable values. Provide examples of when and why constants are useful in programming.

Control Structures (15 points): Describe control structures like if-else statements and loops (e.g., for or while loops). Explain how these structures control the flow of a C++ program. Provide examples of situations where each control structure is typically used.

Part 2: C++ Program (60 points)

Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of variables, constants, and control structures to solve a simple problem. Follow these guidelines:

Problem Description (10 points): Choose a straightforward problem to solve using your C++ program. Describe the problem in a comment block at the beginning of your code.

Variables and Constants (15 points): Declare variables to store relevant data and constants for values that should not change. Ensure you use appropriate data types.

Control Structures (25 points): Implement control structures like if-else statements and loops to solve the problem. Use conditional statements to make decisions or perform actions based on conditions. Utilize loops to repeat specific tasks.

Input and Output (10 points): If applicable to your problem, include input prompts to collect user input and display meaningful output to the console.

Submission:

Submit your C++ program code along with explanations and comments that describe how you applied the programming concepts mentioned in Part 1 to solve the problem in Part 2. Ensure your code is well-structured and follows best practices for readability.

Grading Criteria:

Accuracy and clarity of explanations regarding programming concepts.
Proper use of variables and constants in the program.
Correct implementation of control structures.
Successful execution of the program to solve the chosen problem.
Adequate documentation and comments within the code.
Overall presentation and organization of the submission.

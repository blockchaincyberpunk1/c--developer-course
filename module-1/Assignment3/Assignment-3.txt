Functions in C++

Objective: Understand the concept of functions and their use in C++.

Instructions:

Part 1: Understanding Functions (40 points)

What Are Functions? (15 points): Explain the concept of functions in programming. Discuss why functions are advantageous in organizing code and enhancing code reusability. Provide examples of situations where functions are commonly used.

Defining Functions in C++ (15 points): Describe how functions are defined in C++. Explain the syntax for creating user-defined functions, including function headers, return types, and function bodies. Discuss the role of parameters in functions.

Parameters and Return Values (10 points): Discuss the use of parameters in functions to pass data and the concept of return values to retrieve results. Provide examples of functions with parameters and return values.

Part 2: C++ Program with User-Defined Functions (60 points)

Write a C++ program that defines and uses user-defined functions to perform specific tasks. Follow these guidelines:

Problem Description (10 points): Choose a problem or task that can be solved using functions. Describe the problem in a comment block at the beginning of your code.

Function Definitions (20 points): Define at least two user-defined functions within your program. These functions should encapsulate specific tasks related to the chosen problem. Ensure that you use appropriate parameter types and return values.

Function Calls (15 points): Use function calls to invoke the user-defined functions within your program. Pass appropriate arguments to the functions and store the returned values, if applicable.

Input and Output (15 points): If relevant to your problem, include input prompts to collect user input and display meaningful output to the console.

Submission:

Submit your C++ program code along with explanations and comments that describe the functions you've defined, their purpose, and how they contribute to solving the problem. Ensure your code is well-structured and follows best practices for readability.

Grading Criteria:

Clear and accurate explanations of functions and their advantages.
Properly defined user-defined functions within the program.
Correct use of function calls with appropriate arguments.
Successful execution of the program to solve the chosen problem.
Adequate documentation and comments within the code.
Overall presentation and organization of the submission.

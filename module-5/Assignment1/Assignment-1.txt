Exploring Multithreading in C++

Objective: Explore the fundamentals of multithreading in C++.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will dive into the world of multithreading in C++. You will learn about the basics of multithreading and its significance in achieving concurrency in C++ programs. Additionally, you will create a simple C++ program that utilizes the <thread> library to manage multiple threads concurrently.

Part 1: Understanding Multithreading

Multithreading Introduction: Write a brief explanation of what multithreading is and why it is essential for achieving concurrency in C++ programs. Discuss scenarios where multithreading can lead to improved program performance.

Concurrency vs. Parallelism: Differentiate between concurrency and parallelism in the context of multithreading. Explain how multithreading can achieve concurrency even on single-core systems.

Part 2: Writing a Multithreaded C++ Program

Thread Creation: Develop a C++ program that creates and manages multiple threads. You can choose a specific task or computation that needs to be performed concurrently.

Thread Execution: Implement the logic for each thread to perform a unique task. Ensure that multiple threads execute their tasks concurrently.

Thread Synchronization (Optional): If applicable, demonstrate the use of synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes or semaphores) to coordinate the execution of threads and prevent race conditions.

Part 3: Documentation and Reflection

Code Explanation: Document your C++ program with clear comments explaining the purpose of each thread, their tasks, and any synchronization mechanisms used (if applicable).

Execution Output: Include the output of your program when executed, showcasing how threads are running concurrently.

Reflection: Write a short reflection on your experience with multithreading in C++. Discuss any challenges you encountered, how multithreading improved program performance, and the potential applications of multithreading in real-world scenarios.

Submission:

Submit your well-documented C++ program source code along with the explanation of multithreading concepts and your reflection on the experience.

Grading Criteria:

Understanding of multithreading concepts and their significance.
Correct implementation of a multithreaded C++ program.
Documentation quality, including clear explanations and comments.
Reflection on the experience and insights into the benefits of multithreading.

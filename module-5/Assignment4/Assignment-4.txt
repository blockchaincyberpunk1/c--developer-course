Exploring File I/O Operations in C++

Objective: Explore file input/output (I/O) operations in C++.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will investigate the significance of file input/output (I/O) operations in C++ applications. You will create a C++ program that reads data from an input file, performs operations on the data, and writes the results to an output file using file stream classes (ifstream and ofstream).

Part 1: Understanding File I/O

Importance of File I/O: Explain the importance of file I/O operations in C++ applications. Discuss scenarios where reading data from files and writing data to files is crucial.
Part 2: Developing a File I/O C++ Program

Input and Output Files: Choose or create an input text file that contains data (e.g., a list of numbers, names, or records). Decide on an output file where you will store the results of operations.

C++ Program: Develop a C++ program that performs the following tasks:

Open the input file for reading using the ifstream class.
Read data from the input file, perform operations (e.g., calculations, data processing), and store the results.
Open the output file for writing using the ofstream class.
Write the results to the output file.
Data Manipulation: Implement specific operations on the data read from the input file. These operations should demonstrate the significance of file I/O. For example, you can calculate statistics, transform data, or filter records.

Part 3: Documentation and Explanation

Code Explanation: Document your C++ program with clear comments explaining the purpose of each section of code, including file I/O operations and data manipulation.

Execution Output: Include the output of your program when executed. Display the contents of the input file, the results of data manipulation, and the content of the output file.

Part 4: Reflection

Significance of File I/O: Reflect on the significance of file I/O operations in C++ applications. Discuss how reading data from files and writing results to files enhances program functionality and data persistence.
Submission:

Submit your well-documented C++ program source code, input and output files, explanations of file I/O operations and data manipulation, as well as your reflection on the importance of file I/O in C++ programming.

Grading Criteria:

Understanding of the importance of file I/O in C++ applications.
Correct implementation of a C++ program that reads data from an input file, performs operations, and writes results to an output file.
Effective use of file stream classes (ifstream and ofstream).
Documentation quality, including clear explanations and comments.
Reflection on the significance of file I/O operations in C++ programming.

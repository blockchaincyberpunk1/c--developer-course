 Exploring Synchronization Techniques in C++

Objective: Learn about synchronization mechanisms for thread safety.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will delve into synchronization mechanisms in C++ to ensure thread safety in multithreaded applications. You will develop a C++ program that demonstrates the need for synchronization, the risks of data races, and the effective use of synchronization techniques such as mutexes and condition variables.

Part 1: Understanding the Need for Synchronization

Synchronization in Multithreading: Explain why synchronization is necessary in multithreaded applications. Discuss the consequences of not synchronizing threads, including data races and unpredictable behavior.

Data Races: Define what data races are and how they occur when multiple threads access shared data without proper synchronization. Provide examples of data races and their potential impact on program execution.

Part 2: Developing a Multithreaded C++ Program

Scenario: Choose a scenario for your C++ program where multiple threads need to access and modify shared resources (e.g., a bank account balance, a shared counter, or a bounded buffer). This scenario should illustrate the necessity of synchronization.

Thread Implementation: Develop a C++ program with multiple threads that simulate concurrent operations on shared resources. Ensure that these threads access and modify shared data without proper synchronization, leading to data races.

Synchronization Techniques: Modify your program to incorporate synchronization techniques. Use mutexes to protect critical sections of code where shared data is accessed. Implement condition variables to coordinate thread execution when necessary.

Part 3: Documentation and Explanation

Code Explanation: Document your C++ program with clear comments explaining the purpose of each thread, shared data, and the locations where mutexes and condition variables are applied for synchronization.

Execution Output: Include the output of your program when executed both with and without synchronization. Showcase how synchronization resolves data races and ensures predictable behavior.

Part 4: Reflection

Significance of Synchronization: Reflect on the significance of synchronization mechanisms in multithreaded applications. Discuss how proper synchronization ensures data integrity and program reliability.
Submission:

Submit your well-documented C++ program source code along with explanations of synchronization techniques and their impact on program behavior, as well as your reflection on the importance of synchronization in multithreaded programming.

Grading Criteria:

Understanding of the need for synchronization in multithreaded applications.
Correct implementation of a multithreaded C++ program showcasing data races.
Effective use of synchronization techniques (mutexes and condition variables) to resolve data races.
Documentation quality, including clear explanations and comments.
Reflection on the significance of synchronization in multithreaded applications.
